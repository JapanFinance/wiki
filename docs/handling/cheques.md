# Handling Cheques / Checks

Cheques / Checks are a serious pain to handle in Japan.  Please consider asking whoever has written you a cheque / check to send you money in some other way.

Japan is abolishing support for paper cheques by the end of March 2027. See [this webpage](https://www.zenginkyo.or.jp/tegata-kogitte-haishi/) from the Japanese Bankers Association for more details.

## Details

If you have a bank account or a relative in the country of issuance, you could:

* Use your bank's mobile deposit feature
* Use your bank's "by mail" feature
* Endorse the cheque and ask your relative to cash it for you

Of the major banks, only Prestia will still do it (see https://yatsuyaku.com/clean_bill/):

Starting in 2025, they will only support the following currencies:

* US Dollar (USD)
