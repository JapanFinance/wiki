# Life insurance

One might have financial goals that they want to fulfill even after they die. Probably the most common one is to take care of one’s family if one dies early. To handle this, one can take out life insurance, which pays money if one dies.

Some life insurance also comes with protections against major illnesses, or incapacities, however this page focuses on death coverage.

## Types of life insurance

### Permanent or Whole Life Insurance (終身保険, shūshin hoken)

A whole life insurance never expires: you sign a contract, and as long as you pay the monthly premiums, your beneficiaries will receive the pre-defined amount at your death.

Since eventually everyone dies, this type of insurance is guaranteed to pay. This makes these plans much more expensive than other types of life insurance, which makes them a bad choice for most people.

Some whole life insurance gets packaged with an investment component (e.g. portion of the payout depends on the investment returns). These usually have high fees and [one would always be better off taking out insurance and investing separately](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/1iacnkh/comment/m99hmyq/).

### Term Life Insurance (定期保険, teiki hoken)

Term life insurance, as the name implies, is only good for a certain period of time, e.g. 10, 20, 30 years. You pay a monthly premium during this time, and if you die **during this time** then your beneficiary receives the predefined amount of money. If the term passes and you are still alive, then the contract ends and you don’t receive anything.

This type of insurance can be pretty cheap for young people, as most policy holders won’t die during the term, so the insurance company can use all of their contributions to pay out the small number of people that died. This insurance also matches many people’s needs better: most people want to take care of their family until their kids become independent.

### Income Protection Insurance (収入保障保険, shūnyū hoshō hoken)

This is similar to term life insurance, but instead of a lump sum payout, it provides monthly payments to the beneficiary until the end of the term. This means that the coverage amount is continuously decreasing: if one dies early, then the length of the monthly payouts is longer, so the overall amount is higher. If one dies towards the end of the term, then their beneficiaries might only get a few years of payouts.

The major benefit of this insurance is that it maps the need (taking care of one’s family) better. On the other hand, the chances of dying early are pretty low, so the insurance company can keep the fees lower than a comparable term life insurance.

The downside is that if one dies towards the end, then the payout is small. Another downside is the inheritance tax implication: assuming the insured person themselves paid for the insurance, the present value of the annuity gets added to the estate and gets taxed as inheritance. This could present an immediate tax bill on future payouts. In practice this is usually not an issue due to the [spousal 160 million yen inheritance tax credit](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/tax/inheritance/#:~:text=Surviving%20spouses%20have%20large%20tax%20credit.%20Basically%20you%20find%20out%20how%20much%20inheritance%20tax%20the%20spouse%20is%20theoretically%20supposed%20to%20pay%2C%20and%20then%20you%20reduce%20that%20bill%20to%20the%20extent%20that%20it%20corresponds%20to%20an%20inheritance%20valued%20at%20less%20than%20160%20million%20yen%20(or%2050%25%20of%20the%20estate%2C%20whichever%20is%20larger)), but something to be aware of especially if the estate is big and mainly illiquid (e.g. real estate that the heirs don’t want to sell).

There is an important concept here called guaranteed coverage period(確定保証期, kakutei hoshō-ki). Normally these insurances pay the benefit until their term ends, but if one dies close to the end of the term, this guaranteed coverage period ensures that the beneficiary receives the benefit for at least this long. For example, if the insurance period is 10 years and you die in the 9th year, with a guaranteed coverage period of 2 years, benefits will be paid for 2 years (even past the end of the term).

## When to take out life insurance

Many life insurance providers offer lower premiums for healthy people, usually defined as non-smoker, healthy BMI, healthy blood pressure, and no medical history of serious disease. Many insurers ask for a recent health check result (if you are a company employee, the yearly company health check should be fine).

Moreover, taking out insurance when one is still young results in lower premiums in general (it is less likely to die when young, and if you die later you already paid more into the system).

These together mean that taking out life insurance early generally gives better rates.

## Inflation

Life insurance products in Japan don’t address the concern of a potential high inflation in the future: when you sign a contract both the monthly premiums and the benefits are fixed in nominal terms. If one dies 10-15 years later, then due to inflation the benefit might be worth less than what was originally intended. Until there is an inflation-linked insurance option, the only solution is to choose a higher coverage initially (based on the length of coverage and your inflation assumptions), or add additional coverage later on if inflation gets high.

## Taxes on payouts

The most common case: I pay for my life insurance and my spouse or kids receive it. In this case the amount gets taxed as inheritance (it gets added to the rest of the estate). For whole life and term life, this is simple: the amount gets added directly. For income protection, they calculate a present value or surrender value equivalent of the pension (解約返戻金相当額, kaiyaku henrei-kin sōtō-gaku) and tax that as inheritance. Then the payouts get split into principal (tax free at payout time) and interest (taxed as misc income). More on this [on this NTA page](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/sozoku/4123.htm) and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/1ojt1t0/tax_on_life_insurance_payouts/).

Moreover if the beneficiary is a statutory heir, then [there is an additional 5 million yen per statutory heir tax exemption](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/sozoku/4114.htm) (similar to [inherited DC pensions](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/16d3n78/death_and_dc_pension_benefits/)).

If the payer and insured are different, [then the tax is different](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/shotoku/1750.htm):

| Insured person | Insurance premium payer | Beneficiary | Type of Tax     |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| A              | A                       | B           | Inheritance tax |
| A              | B                       | B           | Income tax (temporary or misc)      |
| A              | B                       | C           | Gift tax        |

For example:
I pay for my insurance, my spouse gets the benefit: inheritance tax
My spouse pays for my insurance, my spouse gets the benefit: income tax (temporary or misc)
My spouse pays for my insurance, my kid gets the benefit: gift tax

## Finding a life insurance

The price comparison website [kakaku.com](https://kakaku.com/) has lists for all 3 types of life insurance: [whole](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/sh/hikaku/s=1/301/), [term](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/tk/hikaku/s=1/301/), [income protection](https://hoken.kakaku.com/gla/dc/hikaku/s=1/301/). Not all insurance companies are on these lists, but they can be a good start.

## Getting a life insurance

### Corporate group life insurance

This is provided through an employer for their employees. Premiums are usually low, and it is more relaxed about pre-existing health conditions. Also the sign-up process is often easier, especially for people with less Japanese ability.

The downside is that it is tied to the employer, so if one leaves the company, then the insurance ends. If one develops some health issues and becomes uninsurable, this can lock them into their job.

### Insurance agencies

[Around 80% of life insurance](https://www.seiho.or.jp/english/statistics/trend/pdf/2024.pdf#page=32) is sold though insurance agents, e.g. ほけんの窓口. They usually have contracts with multiple insurance companies, and can offer not only life insurance but other insurance (car, home, etc.) and some financial planning services too.

### Online

Some insurance providers (e.g. FWD生命, オリックス生命, はなさく生命) allow online sign-ups, though it might still require a phone call if one has any sort of health concern (any medical history or less than perfect health check results).
