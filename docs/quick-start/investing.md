This page gives a quick-start FAQs about starting to invest as a Japanese tax resident.

# Before you begin

## Knowing your inflows and outflows 

You know how much you make. Do you know how much you spend? 

Knowing both these numbers is crucial to know how much you will be able to save and how much you will be able to invest. 
In order to know the spending numbers, you could look at your bank account every day, and/or track your expenses in a 
spreadsheet and/or look at the various expense tracking apps that are run by various fintech companies in Japan. 

The Japanese expense trackers link up with your bank and/or credit card and/or brokerage and/or DC pension holder and/or 
insurance companies, and/or digital wallet providers to build a comprehensive list of expense for each month and/or year. 

That's a lot of and/or. Many of these options have their own advantages and drawbacks. Do consider testing them out to see what 
works for you and what doesn't. 

Also make note of the [Essentials](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/quick-start/essentials) guide to familiarise yourself with necessary 
knowledge for the subsequent sections. 

## Ensure that you have an emergency fund 

Stock markets go up, go down, go sideways. These are complex adaptive systems that are always looking to price in every 
new piece of information as fast as possible. Given that your investments generally have an expected positive net outcome, 
it might be tempting to consider every last yen not-invested as yen wasted.... But do consider that, at the end of the day, you 
need to be able to pay your bills. 

As a general rule of thumb, consider holding between three to twelve months of expenses in your bank account to be able to
have the mental security of knowing that you have money to pay for the next few months "no matter what". 

If you run into an emergency, absolutely dip into this emergency fund. Then pause your investments until you are able to 
rebuild your emergency fund (or at least consider making a glideslope towards this direction). 


## Do not hold high interest debt 

There is zero sense in investing if you have high interest debt. 

Pay it down. 

Immediately. 

Any rate about 8% APR would immediately be considered high-interest. 

Anything between 2% APR to 8% APR would fall under the "debatable" category and there are very large and messy debates
on this topic in every single finance related forum. You would need to make a judgement call about these debts. 


## Paying pensions and health insurance 

For corporate workers, this is automatically deducted from your paycheque.  

If you aren't corporate and/or you don't know if you are paying into the Japanese pension and health insurance systems, 
you need to check in with your employer or check in with your ward office to ensure you are paying into the appropriate systems. 

These payments are mandatory for all residents. 

Check out the [Essentials page section on pensions and health insurance](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/quick-start/essentials/#shakai-hoken-%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%BA-vs-individual-health-insurance-%E5%9B%BD%E6%B0%91%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%BA--pension-%E5%9B%BD%E6%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E9%87%91) 
to ensure that you understand your obligations properly. 


# Investing (the good stuff)

There's a full page [primer on long-investing](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long) in this subreddit wiki. 

## Consider getting an employer match

Depending on your employer benefits, you might be eligible to get an employer match for paying into various retirement benefits.
The specifics of this really depend on your employer. Reach out to your company's HR for the specifics on the retirement benefit. 

A notable difference between employer match in Japan vs. USA, is that it _might not_ make sense to get your employer match in all cases. 

This is because of how the employer match is structured. In the USA, your employer's contributions are generally capped to your voluntary 
contributions, while in Japan, your voluntary contributions are capped by your employer's contribution. 

In many many cases, it still makes sense to maximise your voluntary contributions (either for tax deductions, or because your employer's plan
is decent). Check out your employer's retirement benefits plan, if they have one, and make an informed decision based on your goals. 

## Don't like your employer's plans / don't have a corporate employer?: iDeCo 

💡If you are a US tax resident, be sure to check the subreddit for clarity on the latest stance of the IRS with regards to the iDeCo's tax-exempt 
status. 

💡Note that this is a tax advantaged "account". Similar to how a bank account holds cash, it is an investment account that can also hold financial securities.  iDeCo accounts are generally considered preferable to normal taxable accounts, and offer even greater tax efficiency than NISA (see below).  They are the most tax efficient way to purchase and hold the securities that you are interested in.

iDeco's key benefit is that money paid into the account is deducted from your pre-tax income thus reducing your income tax liability.  The main 'drawback' is that the money invested is treated like a pension and generally unavailable until the holder turns 65.  They also have relatively restrictive monthly investment limits.

Go to the [iDeCo](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#tax-advantaged-accounts--ideco) section of the wiki. Similar to the employer
matched contributions, this might not make sense for you based on your circumstances (such as if you plan to leave Japan, never to return). 


### iDeCo + Employer matches

Since 2022 you are able to maintain an iDeCo while having a Corporate DC plan with your employer. This is described in the iDeCo wiki page 
referenced above, but called out here additionally, explicitly.


## Have money left after building up your emergency fund? : NISA

💡If you are a US tax resident, at the time of writing, IBKR and Nomura are among the only providers that will offer you a NISA account. Additionally,
in this NISA, you need to avoid using the Tsumitate portion because it can currently only hold domestic mutual funds, which are all 
PFICs. You may use the General (seicho, 成長) portion to purchase individual stocks (US and Japanese) and US based ETFs and only pay US taxes on it. 

💡Note that this is a tax advantaged "Account". Similar to a bank account that holds money, these investment accounts hold financial securities. NISA accounts
are preferable to normal taxable accounts (see below) as they allow for a more efficient way to hold the securities that you are interested in purchasing.

Go to the [NISA](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#tax-advantaged--accounts--nisa) section of the wiki. 

The subsequent section on [Providers](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#providers) gives a list of providers for a taxable investing account. 

When it comes to NISA, basically every single financial services company will offer to open a NISA account for you.  Before committing to a particular
provider, consider their lineup of mutual funds, and whether or not the products offered meet your investment goals. If you have already committed to a provider that you do not like, it is possible to switch your provider.


Additionally, be sure to check out the [NISA FAQ Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/181kb33/new_nisa_questions_thread/). 

## Still have money left over? : Taxable Accounts 

Japan has a super convenient investment account called a special/specific account with automatic tax withholding (特定口座 源泉徴収あり, tokutei-kouza gensen-choushuu-ari).  These accounts allow the financial institutions offering them to automatically calculate and withhold the appropriate amount of capital
gains tax from your account each time you sell something. As a result, you do not need to report capital gains from these accounts. If your employer
takes care of your taxes via a YETA, and you do not have any alternate sources of income, this account lets you avoid filing a tax return altogether. 

If you would like to file Japanese taxes manually, and/or defer the tax withholding, you can request for a special/specific account without tax withholding 
(特定口座 源泉徴収なし, tokutei-kouza gensen-choushuu-nashi) account instead. In this account, the tax withholding is computed for you, and at the end of the year
a report is generated that you can link with your tax returns to pay any taxes on your capital gains the following year.

## What should I buy? 

For most people, buying a globally diversified low cost index fund would satisfy their investing requirements. On the r/JapanFinance subreddit, the most popular
example of such a fund would be the eMaxis Slim All Country (eMaxis Slim全世界株式(オール･カントリー), eMaxis Slim zen-sekai-kabushiki (All Country), オルカン). 
This is just one example of a globally diversified index fund, with some of the lowest management fees. There are other choices available to you that are equally valid. 

Some people disagree with the statement above, and will instead recommend a variety of alternative investments. As part of this quickstart guide however,
none of these other options can be recommended as broadly as a globally diversified low cost index fund. You are encouraged to check out r/JapanFinance wiki for
supporting and opposing beliefs specific alternatives to globally diversified low cost index funds. 


## General Investing Cautions: !!

### "Old" NISA (kyu NISA, 旧NISA)

Until 2023, a different "NISA" system was available in Japan. Rather than one account with two individual portions. This old NISA system consisted of two 
types of accounts. 

As a result, a lot of information / ChatGPT tends to give incorrect responses. Even though it is not applicable, it might be worthwhile making note of the [old NISA](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#old-nisa--regular-nisa) 
systems in order to get a clearer understanding if the information you are receiving is out-of-date or not. 

### MAXIS ETFs / eMaxis Series 

In addition to running the popular eMaxis Slim series of low cost index funds, MUFJ also runs the not-quite-as-popular MAXIS ETFs such as 
2558.T (MAXIS S&P500 US Equity ETF) and 2559.T (MAXIS World Equity (MSCI ACWI) ETF). Even more confusingly, MUFJ also runs the "eMaxis" series
Japanese domestic mutual funds, and sell this via various banks / face-to-face outlets. 

These are not the eMaxis Slim series that are well and truly beloved in the r/JapanFinance subreddit. Make sure you know what is being sold to you. 

### Accumulating Japanese Domestic Mutual Funds 

Finance information on Reddit (a US-platform) tends to be US centric. As a result, many subreddits preach the gospel of US ETFs. For non-US residents, 
a blanket EU based UCITS ETFs are recommended for better estate taxes.

Japan is one of the few countries for which this blanket advice of using UCITS ETFs does not apply. This is due to a favorable Japan-US tax treaty. As a result, US ETFs can be purchased by Japanese residents when an equivalent domestic mutual fund can not be found.

However, for most non-US tax residents, Japanese domestic mutual funds are a superior option to ETFs because:

- they are accumulating: they reinvest dividends internally without incurring any additional taxes.  This is especially important in the tax advantaged accounts as it allows your investment to grow without needing to re-invest dividends yourself, which would use up your precious tax-free allowances.

- they are convenient: no dividends = even in taxable accounts there are no taxes to worry about until assets are sold.

- they are domestic: you can put them in a NISA account.  And when purchased in a tax-withheld specific account (特定口座 源泉あり, tokutei-kouza gensen-ari) can avoid declaring capital gains as the taxes are deducted automatically


### Credit Card Investing: Not insanity 

As long as you manage your credit card spending carefully, a credit card can offer great benefits. This is also true in Japan. Depending on which credit card(s) you have, 
you can link them to a corresponding broker and enjoy ~0.5% to ~2% point returns on up to ¥100,000 of your monthly securities purchases.  (i.e. ~500 to 
2000 points). Some brokers also allow securities to purchased with the points you earn on your credit card.

With the precaution of having an emergency fund, it is possible to carefully dip your toes into this trickle of free-money. 

Some providers offer a better rate if you use the 100,000 contribution limits in a NISA account. Check your provider's website for the
latest benefits on offer.
