This page gives a quick-start FAQs about starting to invest as a Japanese tax resident.

# Before you begin

## Knowing your inflows and outflows 

You know how much you make. Do you know how much you spend? 

Knowing both these numbers are crucial to know how much you will be able to save and how much you will be able to invest. 
In order to know the spending numbers, you could look at your bank account every day, and/or track your expenses in a 
spreadsheet and/or look at the various expense tracking apps that are run by various fintech companies in Japan. 

The Japanese expense trackers link up with your bank and/or credit card and/or brokerage and/or DC pension holder and/or 
insurance companies, and/or digital wallet providers to build a comprehensive list of expense for each month and/or year. 

That's a lot of and/or. Many of these options have their own advantages and drawbacks. Do consider testing them out to see what 
works for you and what doesn't. 

Also make note of the [Essentials](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/quick-start/essentials) guide to familiarise yourself with necessary 
knowledge for the subsequent sections. 

## Ensure that you have an emergency fund 

Stock markets go up, go down, go sideways. These are complex adaptive systems that are always looking to price in every 
new piece of information as fast as possible. Given that your investments generally have an expected positive net outcome, 
it might be tempting to consider every last yen not-invested as yen wasted.... But do consider that at the end of the day, you 
need to be able to pay your bills. 

As a general rule of thumb consider holding between three to twelve months of expenses in your bank account to be able to
have the mental security knowing that you have money to pay for the next few months "no matter what". 

If you run into an emergency, absolutely dip into this emergency fund. Then, pause your investments until you are able to 
rebuild your emergency fund (or at least consider making a glideslope towards this direction). 


## Do not hold high interest debt 

There is zero sense in investing if you have high interest debt. 

Pay it down. 

Immediately. 

Any rate about 8% APR would immediately be considered high-interest. 

Anything between 2% APR to 8% APR would fall under the "debatable" category and there are very large and messy debates
on this topic in every single finance related forum. You would need to make a judgement call about these debts. 


## Paying pensions and health insurance 

For the corporate workers, this is automatically deducted from your paycheque.  

If you aren't a corporate and/or you don't know if you are paying into the Japanese pension and health insurance systems, 
you need to check in with your employer or check in with your ward office to ensure you are paying into the appropriate systems. 

These payments are mandatory for all residents. 

Check out the [Essentials page section on pensions and health insurance](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/quick-start/essentials/#shakai-hoken-%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%BA-vs-individual-health-insurance-%E5%9B%BD%E6%B0%91%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%BA--pension-%E5%9B%BD%E6%B0%91%E5%B9%B4%E9%87%91) 
to ensure that you understand your obligations properly. 


# Investing (the good stuff)

There's a full page [primer on long-investing](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long) in this subreddit wiki. 

## Consider getting an employer match

Depending on your employer benefits, you might be eligible to get an employer match for either paying into various retirement benefits.
The specifics of this really depend on your employer. Reach out to your company's HR for the specifics on the retirement benefit. 

A notable difference between employer match in Japan vs. USA, is that it _might not_ make sense to get your employer match in all cases. 

This is because of how the employer match is structured. In the USA, your employer's contributions are generally capped to your voluntary 
contributions, while in Japan, your voluntary contributions are capped by your employer's contribution. 

In many many cases, it still makes sense to maximise your voluntary contributions (either for tax deductions, or because your employer's plan
is decent). Check out your employer's retirement benefits plan if they have one and make an informed decision based on your goals. 

## Don't like your employer's plans / don't have a corporate employer?: iDeCo 

💡If you are a US tax resident, be sure to check the subreddit for clarity on the latest stance of the IRS with regards to the iDeCo's tax-exempt 
status. 

💡Note that this is an "Account". Similar to a bank account that holds money, this investment account would hold financial securities. The account
is preferred over a normal taxable account (see below) as it would allow for more efficient way to hold the securities that you are interested in purchasing.

Go to the [iDeCo](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#tax-advantaged-accounts--ideco) section of the wiki. Similar to the employer
matched contributions, this might not make sense for you based on your circumstances (such as if you plan to leave Japan, never to return). 


### iDeCo + Employer matches

Since 2022 you are able to maintain an iDeCo while having a Corporate DC plan with your employer. This is described in the iDeCo wiki page 
referenced above, but called out here additionally, explicitly.


## Have money left after building up your emergency fund? : NISA

💡If you are a US tax resident, at the time of writing, IBKR and Nomura are among the only providers that will offer you a NISA account. Additionally,
in this NISA, you need to avoid using the Tsumitate portion because this portion currently only allows domestic mutual funds to be held in it, which are all 
PFICs. You may use the General (seicho, 成長) portions to purchase individual stocks (US and Japanese) and US based ETFs and only pay US taxes on it. 

💡Note that this is an "Account". Similar to a bank account that holds money, this investment account would hold financial securities. The account
is preferred over a normal taxable account (see below) as it would allow for more efficient way to hold the securities that you are interested in purchasing.

Go to the [NISA](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#tax-advantaged--accounts--nisa) section of the wiki. 

The subsequent section on [Providers](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#providers) gives a list of providers for a taxable investing account. 

When it comes to NISA, basically every single financial services company will offer to provide a NISA account to you.  Before committing to any
provider, consider their lineup and whether or not the products offered meet your investment goals. If you have already committed to a provider that you
do not like, you can switch your provider.


Additionally, be sure to check out the [NISA FAQ Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanFinance/comments/181kb33/new_nisa_questions_thread/). 

## Still have money left over? : Taxable Accounts 

Japan a super convenient account type called special/specific account with tax withholding (特定口座 源泉徴収あり, tokutei-kouza gensen-choushuu-ari).
These accounts allow the financial institution providing you with the account to automatically calculate and withhold the appropriate amount of capital
gains from your account each time you sell something. As a result, you do not need to report capital gains from such accounts. If your employer
takes care of your taxes via a YETA and you do not have an alternate source of income, this account lets you skip needing to make a tax return altogether. 

If you would like to file Japanese taxes manually, and/or defer the tax withholding, you can request for a special/specific account without tax withholding 
(特定口座 源泉徴収なし, tokutei-kouza gensen-choushuu-nashi) account instead. In this account, the tax withholding is computed for you, and at the end of the year
a report is generated that you can link with your tax returns to pay your taxes.

## What should I buy? 

For most people, buying a globally diversified low cost index fund would satisfy their investing requirements. On the r/JapanFinance subreddit, the most popular
example of such a fund would be the eMaxis Slim All Country (eMaxis Slim全世界株式(オール･カントリー), eMaxis Slim zen-sekai-kabushiki (All Country), オルカン). 
This is just one example of the a globally diversified low cost index fund. There are other choices available to you that are all equally valid. 

Many people disagree with the statement above, and instead recommend a variety of things that you should invest in instead. As part of the quickstart guide however,
none of these other options would apply as generally to you as a globally diversified low cost index fund. You are encouraged to check out r/JapanFinance wiki for
supporting and opposing beliefs on your specific alternative to a globally diversified low cost index fund. 


## General Investing Cautions: !!

### "Old" NISA (kyu NISA, 旧NISA)

Until 2023, a different "NISA" system was available in Japan. Rather than one account with two individual portions. This old NISA system consisted of two 
types of accounts. 

As a result, a lot of information / ChatGPT tends to give incorrect responses. Even though it is not applicable, it might be worthwhile making note of the [old NISA](https://wiki.japanfinance.org/investing/long/#old-nisa--regular-nisa) 
systems in order to get a clearer understanding if the information you are receiving is out-of-date or not. 

### MAXIS ETFs / eMaxis Series 

In addition to running the popular eMaxis Slim series of low cost index funds, MUFJ also runs the not-quite-as-popular MAXIS ETFs such as 
2558.T (MAXIS S&P500 US Equity ETF) and 2559.T (MAXIS World Equity (MSCI ACWI) ETF). Even more confusingly, MUFJ also runs the "eMaxis" series
Japanese domestic mutual funds, and sell this via various banks / face-to-face outlets. 

These are not the eMaxis Slim series that is well and truly beloved in the r/JapanFinance subreddit. Make sure you know what is being sold to you. 

### Accumulating Japanese Domestic Mutual Funds 

Finance information on Reddit (a US-platform) tends to be US centric. As a result, many subreddits preach the gospel of US ETFs. For non-US residents, 
a blanket EU based UCITS ETFs are recommended for better estate taxes.

Japan is one of the few countries for which this blanket advice of using UCITS ETFs do not apply. This is due to a favourable Japan-US tax treaty. US ETFs, 
as a result, can be purchased by Japanese residents when an equivalent domestic mutual fund can not be found.

For most non-US tax residents, Japanese domestic mutual funds are the superior option to US (and EU and Japanese) ETFs because 

- they are accumulating: they reinvest dividends internally without incurring any additional taxes. 

- they are convenient: no dividends = no taxes to worry about until sale

- they are domestic: you can put them in a NISA or a tax-withheld specific account (特定口座 源泉あり, tokutei-kouza gensen-ari) and avoid declaring capital gains as the taxes are deducted automatically


### Credit Card Investing: Not insanity 

As long as you manage your credit card spending carefully, a credit card offers great benefits. This is also true in Japan. Depending on which credit card you have, 
you can link the card to the corresponding broker and enjoy ~0.5% to ~2% point returns each month upto a contribution limit of 100,000 per month (i.e. ~500 points to 
2000 points). 

With the precaution of having an emergency fund, it is possible to carefully dip your toes into this stream of free-money. 

Some providers offer a better rate if you use this 100,000 contribution limits in a NISA account. Check your preferred provider's website for the
latest benefits on offer.
